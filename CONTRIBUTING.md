- **Feature development**: New functionality and capability enhancements  
- **Testing**: Automated tests and validation scripts
- **Code cleanup**: Refactoring and optimization improvements

## Contribution Workflow

### 1. **Choose Your Contribution**
- **First-time contributors**: Look for `first-timers-only` labeled issues
- **Beginners**: Check `good first issue` labeled items
- **Experienced**: Browse `help wanted` and `enhancement` issues
- **Experts**: Tackle `platform-*` or `domain-*` specific challenges

### 2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RuckerShyne/CyberHydrationKit.git
cd CyberHydrationKit

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-enhancement

# Install dependencies (if contributing code)
.\Install-Dependencies.ps1
```

### 3. **Make Your Changes**
- **Follow existing code style** and documentation patterns
- **Test your changes** using provided validation scripts
- **Update documentation** if you're adding new features
- **Add comments** explaining complex logic or configurations

### 4. **Test Your Contribution**
```powershell
# For code changes - run validation
.\Test-CyberLabDeployment.ps1 -ValidationOnly

# For documentation - check formatting
# Use a Markdown linter or preview tool

# For configurations - test deployment
.\Deploy-CyberLab.ps1 -ConfigFile custom-config.json -ValidationOnly
```

### 5. **Submit Your Pull Request**
- **Write a clear title** describing your contribution
- **Provide detailed description** of changes and motivations
- **Reference related issues** using GitHub keywords (fixes #123)
- **Include testing information** showing your changes work
- **Be responsive** to code review feedback

## Contribution Guidelines

### **Code Standards**
- **PowerShell**: Follow PowerShell best practices and use approved verbs
- **JSON/Configuration**: Validate syntax and maintain consistent formatting
- **Documentation**: Use clear, professional language with proper grammar
- **Comments**: Explain the "why" not just the "what" in your code

### **Documentation Standards**
- **Screenshots**: 1920x1080 resolution, remove sensitive information
- **Configuration examples**: Anonymize IP addresses, passwords, and personal data
- **Performance data**: Include system specifications and deployment context
- **Learning content**: Specify difficulty level and estimated completion time

### **Security Considerations**
- **Never commit secrets**: No passwords, API keys, or sensitive data
- **Sanitize examples**: Remove real IP addresses, hostnames, and credentials
- **Review security impact**: Consider how changes affect lab isolation and safety
- **Follow responsible disclosure**: Report security issues privately first
